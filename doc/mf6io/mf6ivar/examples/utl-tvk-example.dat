# Cell 5 will have its K value changed to 1e-3 in the first time step of
# stress period 2, and changed once more to 1e-4 in the first time step of
# stress period 4.
#
# Cells 101 and 108 will have their respective K33 values changed according
# to the time series cells_kz specified in the file tvk_cells.ts. Note that
# these values may continue to change beyond stress period 2, depending on
# the duration of the time series cells_sy.
#
# No changes are made in stress period 1 due to an absence of a block
# for that period; cells maintain the initial property values specified in
# the NPF package for the entirety of that period.
