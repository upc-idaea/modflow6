# Cell 45 will have its SS value changed to 1e-6 in the first time step of
# stress period 2, and changed once more to 1e-7 in the first time step of
# stress period 4.
#
# Cells 188 and 291 will have their respective SY values changed according
# to the time series cells_sy specified in the file tvs_cells.ts. Note that
# these values may continue to change beyond stress period 2, depending on
# the duration of the time series cells_sy.
#
# No changes are made in stress period 1 due to an absence of a block
# for that period; cells maintain the initial property values specified in
# the STO package for the entirety of that period.
