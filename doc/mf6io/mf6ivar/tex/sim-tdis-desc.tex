\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{time\_units}---is the time units of the simulation.  This is a text string that is used as a label within model output files.  Values for time\_units may be ``unknown'',  ``seconds'', ``minutes'', ``hours'', ``days'', or ``years''.  The default time unit is ``unknown''.

\item \texttt{start\_date\_time}---is the starting date and time of the simulation.  This is a text string that is used as a label within the simulation list file.  The value has no effect on the simulation.  The recommended format for the starting date and time is described at https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime.

\item \texttt{ATS6}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to an adaptive time step (ATS) input file.  The behavior of ATS and a description of the input file is provided separately.

\item \texttt{FILEIN}---keyword to specify that an input filename is expected next.

\item \texttt{ats6\_filename}---defines an adaptive time step (ATS) input file defining ATS controls.  Records in the ATS file can be used to override the time step behavior for selected stress periods.

\item \textbf{Block: DIMENSIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{nper}---is the number of stress periods for the simulation.

\end{description}
\item \textbf{Block: PERIODDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{perlen}---is the length of a stress period.

\item \texttt{nstp}---is the number of time steps in a stress period.

\item \texttt{tsmult}---is the multiplier for the length of successive time steps. The length of a time step is calculated by multiplying the length of the previous time step by TSMULT. The length of the first time step, $\Delta t_1$, is related to PERLEN, NSTP, and TSMULT by the relation $\Delta t_1= perlen \frac{tsmult - 1}{tsmult^{nstp}-1}$.
